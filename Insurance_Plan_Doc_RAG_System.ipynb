For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $156 a day (subject to adjustment based on inflation) until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for Benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, and if you have exhausted the claims procedures available to you under the plan, you may file suit in a state or Federal court.\n",

The Plan that covers the person other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers the person as a dependent is the Secondary Plan.
